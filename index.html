<h2>about me</h2>i'm primarily a backend dev, but i do frontend too. that's really it. i program stuff.

<h2>languages</h2>c|html|lua|python|ruby|java|javascript|xml

<h2>notable projects</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/notsign/893FinalProject">893 LibGDX project</a> | JAVA

i worked on this project with two other classmates for my senior year of high school. we developed a game for Android using LibGDX, and i developed the engine used.

this project ended up being incomplete, but the real magic comes from the amount of progress and how much we learned in so little time. it's sort of like my origin story.

assets used in the program are not original and are taken from other properties, we only own the code we wrote.


<a href='https://github.com/hydr4x/AshleyTest'>AshleyTest</a> | JAVA

derived off the above project, i integrated another third party library that would assist with grouping of entities within our game. it's like a part II to 893 LibGDX project.


<a href='https://github.com/hydr4x/FreeToPlay'>FreeToPlay</a> | JAVASCRIPT/HTML

i created an html page that would pull the "Free to Play" champions for the popular game <a href="http://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US">League of Legends</a>.

if i ever had to point to where i started learning how to do backend dev, this would be it. it's a simple jquery ajax to an api, but it taught me the basics of json and database pulls.

<a href='https://vimeo.com/164639923'>Awesome Adventure</a> | PYTHON

i was asked to write/debug some python scripts for my friend for her film. most of it was simple stuff like camera management, but i'm happy i could be of some use. i don't have the code archived anywhere, but i'm in the credits.

thanks, elaina


<a href='https://github.com/hydr4x/RPGbot'>RPGbot</a> | JAVASCRIPT

i made a bot for use in the voip program Discord. this bot would be able to take commands from the chat program and simulate an RPG game within the client.

again, another project that was mostly learning how to deal with an api.


<a href="https://github.com/hydr4x/barks">barksbot</a> | JAVASCRIPT

originally used to play the sound effect of a dog barking (yes seriously), it ended up being a general music player. plays a song based on the command entered.


<a href="https://devpost.com/software/healthsimple">healthsimple</a> | JAVA/XML

i attended a hackathon at the Google KW offices named <a href="http://devswithoutborders.org/breakinequality/">Br/eakInequality</a>. there, i, along with 4 others, created a system that involved both SMS and an Android app.

a lot of the details about the project are in the link provided, and it's put together pretty well. shoutouts to the business side of our team for that.

my role in this project was primarily the backend developer. i implemented the Twilio api, database processing, and assisted in the creation of the Android app.

we placed top 10, and won the category of Best Pitch. there were 23 teams of around 4-5 people each.

i was also the only student not from university of waterloo, lol (every attendee was from that school)
