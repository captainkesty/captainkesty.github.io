        <h1>amateur coder</h1>

        <p>you can see my repositories at <a href="https://github.com/captainkesty">my github</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="about">about me</h2>

        <p>i started coding at the age of 13, where i learned to script in Lua for the games <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/">Garry's Mod</a> and <a href="https://roblox.com">ROBLOX</a>.</p>

        <p>in high school, i learned algorithmic and interface programming in Java. i also learned how to develop applications and games for the Android OS.</p>

        <h2 id="languages">languages</h2>

        <h2 id="projects">projects</h2>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/notsign/893FinalProject">893 LibGDX project</a> | JAVA</p>

        <p>i worked on this project with two other classmates for my senior year of high school. we developed a game for Android using LibGDX, and i developed the engine used.</p>
        <p>this project ended up using a variety of different programs. examples include: tiled (map creator), texturepacker (putting together assets), LibGDX (the library we primarily used).</p>
        <p>assets used in the program are not original and are taken from other properties, we only own the code we wrote.</p>

        <p><a href='https://github.com/captainkesty/AshleyTest'>AshleyTest</a> | JAVA</p>

        <p>derived off the above project, i integrated another third party library that would assist with grouping of entities within our game.</p>

        <p><a href='https://github.com/captainkesty/FreeToPlay'>FreeToPlay</a> | JAVASCRIPT/HTML</p>

        <p>i created an html page that would pull the "Free to Play" champions for the popular game <a href="http://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US">League of Legends</a>. this taught me how to deal with APIs and push/pull requests with an external database</p>

        <p><a href='https://vimeo.com/164639923'>Awesome Adventure</a> | PYTHON</p>

        <p>i was contracted to write some python scripts for my friend for her film. i was tasked with simplifying the process of managing different cameras. i don't have the code archived anywhere, but i'm in the credits.</p>

        <p><a href='https://github.com/captainkesty/RPGbot'>RPGbot</a> | JAVASCRIPT</p>

        <p>i made a bot for use in the voip program Discord. this bot would be able to take commands from the chat program and simulated an RPG game within the client. if you've played Final Fantasy, this is similar.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/captainkesty/barks">barksbot</a> | JAVASCRIPT</p>

        <p>originally used to play the sound effect of a dog barking, it ended up being a general music player. plays a song based on the command entered. also a Discord bot.</p>

        <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/healthsimple">healthsimple</a> | JAVA/XML</p>

        <p>i attended a hackathon at the Google KW offices named <a href="http://devswithoutborders.org/breakinequality/">BreakInequality</a>. there, i, along with 4 others, created a system that involved both SMS and an Android app.</p>
        <p>a lot of the details about the system are in the link provided. my role in this project was primarily the backend developer. i implemented the Twilio API, database processing, and assisted in the creation of the Android app.</p>
        <p>we placed top 10, and won the category of Best Pitch. there were 23 teams of around 4-5 people each.</p>
